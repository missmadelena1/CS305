Question: Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Answer: Artemis Financial would like for us at Global Rain to assist in modernizing their applications by using the most current and effective security software applications. Since Artemis has a public web interface, they are seeking our services to secure their most valuable assets, client data and financial information. Artemis Financial would like our assistance in ensuring secure communication by affind a file verification step to their current web applications. We must take this into consideration by adding secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements with adherence to security policies and quality controls.
    
Question: What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Answer: I did well at finding the vulnerabilities within the code and assessing them. This is important as finding vulnerabilities within code can keep the software secure. Assessing vulnerabilities helps us in not only securing our code, but watching for errors that may arise in the near future. In the long run with vulnerability assessments and updates when available will keep software up to date on all security and thus, increasing reputation and reliability. 
    
Question: What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Answer: The vulnerability assessment overall was hard to understand in the beginning, but after tutorials and practicing the test, it became much easier to code and check for vulnerabilities. The tool is reliable and gets us results quickly instead of manual testing, this in return saves time and money when developing software. 
    
Question: How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Answer: I approached this need by checking for vulnerabilities and getting rid of false positives within code. In the future, I would use penetration testing to test the code. 

Question:How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Answer: I made certain the code and software application were functional and secure by running the dependency check multiple times after getting rid of false positives with supression. To check if new vulnerabilities were added, I ran the dependency check after each supression.

Question: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Answer: I think that watching insightful YoutTube Videos helped alot in this assignment. I find that I am a visual learner and can retain information and learning by the hands on experience afterwards. I will take this on with my future work.

Question: Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Answer: I would show my employers the vulnerability check and how we can utilize outside resources to save precious time. I work for AWS currently, and can see the dependency check being used within this large tech company.
